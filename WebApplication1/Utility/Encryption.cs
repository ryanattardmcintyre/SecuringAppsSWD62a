    //Symmetric Encryption/Decryption //use this one to enc/dec the querystring values
    //Same key to encryption and decrypt
    //Adv: Fastest, Simpler
    //it uses Secret Key and IV + salt
    //Disadv: you have to be very careful if you are going to use this one when sending files over an insecure network

    //Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption
    //It uses two different keys: Public Key and Private key
    //Public Key: encrypt
    //Private Key: decrypt (its always recommended never to send over an insecure network the private key)
    //Adv: we now can transfer the keys securely over an insecure network
    //Disadv: this is a slow performing algorithm, you cannot encrypt/decrypt large data. normally used to encrypt base64 data


    //Hybrid Encryption/Decryption //this is need to encrypt the files uploaded by the students & decrypt the files when they are needed by the teacher
    //we r going to take the adv of both the symmetric and the asymmetric to form the hybrid
    //we are going to send over the insecure network the encrypted data which was encrypted symmetrically and therefore we are going to send the
    //encrypted symmetric keys (which were encrypted with the public key)


    //Hashing
    //1 way encryption
    //usage: in passwords
    //sha512
    //two different values should give two different digests e.g. "hello world" and "helloworld" >> 2 different digests


    //Digital Signing/verify
    //against repudiation (when an attacker tampers with the data and he denies the activity)
    //suggestion for the assignment: you generate a private & public key for every student
    //when the user uploads the file, you take the private key and you sign the file and you store the signature with the file's data
    //when the user/teacher needs to download/view the file we need to use the file's owner public key + signature, to verify whether the data is still the same 
    //   i.e belonging to that user
